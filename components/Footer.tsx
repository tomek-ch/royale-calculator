          Have you ever wondered how much gold and how many cards you need to
          upgrade your deck in Clash Royale?
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          With Calculator Royale, you can simply enter your player tag, copy
          your deck and get instant results based on your card counts and
          levels.
        </p>
        <p className="pb-1">
          You can adjust the selected cards and their levels to test different
          scenarios and plan out how to upgrade your deck. With features such as
          bulk editing and level sync the whole process is super quick.
